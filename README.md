# German Car Purchase Data Analysis

This project analyzes trends in German car sales using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to uncover insights for consumers, dealerships, and manufacturers related to fuel efficiency, pricing, and performance.

## Questions Explored

- Do manual or automatic cars have better fuel economy?
- Which fuel types are most efficient and powerful?
- How does mileage impact car price?
- Is there a correlation between horsepower and price?

## Key Insights
